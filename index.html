            Sarah Seiyuen Kim is an experience designer and multimedia artist shaping the aesthetics of human-machine interaction. Through new media technologies and critical research methods, she explores time, memory, and cultural identity from perspectives of the current civilizational moment. Pursuing a B.S. in Integrated Design and Media at NYU Tandon (May 2025), she blends sound, image, touch, and computation to craft sensory narratives. Her work, rooted in storytelling, reimagines collective presence and challenges colonial legacies. Inspired by phantasmagoria and natural patterns, she is also a cellist, composer, writer, and visionary enchanted by existence.

            <p> 
                Sarah Seiyuen Kim is an experience designer and multimedia artist shaping the aesthetics of human-machine interaction. Through new media technologies and critical research methods, her work investigates time, memory, and cultural identity from perspectives of the contemporary cultural moment. 
            </p>
            <p>She will complete a B.S. in Integrated Design and Media at NYU Tandon School of Engineering in May 2025, with a minor in Media, Culture, and Communication. She is currently exploring how computation transforms human emotion, thought, and behavior, through algorithmic art and examinations of the human psyche within social, environmental, and conceptual ecologies.
            </p>
          <p>Her technical practice is grounded in a formal education in design fundamentals. She is experienced in graphic design, sound design, live signal processing, film production, projection and installation design, interaction design, front- and back-end development, circuit design, and more. Working on individual and collaborative projects, she has developed a dynamic process that understands both personal and shared visions. </p>
         <p>
            At the heart of her practice is the age-old tradition of storytelling. Stories connect us across generations and cultures, both reminding and reimagining collective presences. She constructs meaningful narratives by designing sensory experiences inspired to nourish cultural memory, spirit, and functioning. Her senior thesis, an interactive sound installation, explores sound, indeterminacy, and consciousness, reimagining identities beyond colonial frameworks.
         </p>
          <p>Among other things, Sarah is an impressionist artist, experimental and classically trained cellist, writer, composer, and learner of new languages. She is inspired by phantasmagoria, natural patterns, and vanishing points. She is curious about semantics, cybernetics, natural patterns and is endlessly enchanted by the mysteries of life~

            description: `
                <p>In Between is a short documentary film that grasps at the unknown pulsing through each moment. Filmed within moving vehicles—cars, buses, subways—it captures the fleetingness of truth and understanding, a sensation of losing what we once held as certain. Kim renders the perpetual death and rebirth of living experience: shedding preconceived notions to weave new ones, only to be swallowed again by the vast unknown where connections form and dissolve.</p>

                <p>The film questions the malleability of self. If identity emerges from environment and others’ perceptions, what remains true when all we’ve known fractures? Through a first-person lens, In Between suspends viewers at the crossroads of dreaming and waking, stitching together moments Kim documented across New York City. In transit—alienated yet entwined with the world—she observes reality’s uncertainty unfold, perception bending through senses, bodies, and emotions.</p>

                <p>When did you realize all you knew was but a shard of truth? This work surrenders to that question, embracing the ambiguity—a paradoxical dance of comfort and unsettlement. How does one move forward, purposeful, in perpetual flux? In Between offers no answers, only the space to linger in the unfathomed. </p>

            description: `
                <p>Still Life is an audio installation that unveils the resonant interplay between everyday objects and our sensory world, tuning into their hidden sonic life. Inspired by the urban hum of machinery, Sarah Seiyuen Kim amplifies the overlooked acoustics of household items—objects that, though still, hum with energy, threading sound waves into our primal core. The piece beckons listeners to reconsider their bond with the material realm. </p>

                <p>At its core lies a handcrafted audio system: a piezo contact microphone, an amplifier, and a transducer speaker, fused by a soldered circuit. Placed on a shared surface, this setup births a feedback loop—listening to itself as it magnifies the material’s natural pulse. The result is a living chorus of resonance, a soundscape that questions perception and stirs reflection on the vibrant stillness around us.</p>
